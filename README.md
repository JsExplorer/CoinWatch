# [CoinWatch](coin-watch-psi.vercel.app)

CoinWatch is a cryptocurrency tracking website for latest price on top 10 cryptocurrencies and top 7 trending cryptocurrencies. It is added with a portfolio management feature that allows users to track and manage their cryptocurrency investments. With real-time cryptocurrency price data, CoinWatch provides users with insights into their portfolio's performance.

## Planning
- [Trello](https://trello.com/b/H3sSYjBG/coinwatch)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Ds8Pv7Hxlmd3kIlewPyQuM/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)

I utilised Trello for project planning and Figma for wireframes to visualize the app's structure and features. Trello boards helped manage tasks and keep the project organized. THe simple Wireframes provided a blueprint for the app's layout and functionality.

## Basic layout
3 pages 
- Home page - Chart page - Portfolio page
