# [CoinWatch](coin-watch-psi.vercel.app)

CoinWatch is a cryptocurrency tracking website for latest price on top 10 cryptocurrencies and top 7 trending cryptocurrencies. It is added with a portfolio management feature that allows users to track and manage their cryptocurrency investments. With real-time cryptocurrency price data, CoinWatch provides users with insights into their portfolio's performance.

## Planning 
- [Trello](https://trello.com/b/H3sSYjBG/coinwatch)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Ds8Pv7Hxlmd3kIlewPyQuM/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)

I utilised Trello for project planning and Figma for wireframes to visualize the app's structure and features. Trello boards helped manage tasks and keep the project organized. THe simple Wireframes provided a blueprint for the app's layout and functionality.

## Basic layout
3 pages 
Home page - Chart page - Portfolio page
    
## Featured Components
- Real-Time Price Data: CoinWatch fetches real-time cryptocurrency price data from CoinGecko.
- Search Functionality: Users can search for specific cryptocurrencies to add to their portfolio.
- Total Portfolio Value: The app calculates and displays the total value of the user's cryptocurrency portfolio. <<Utilised Airtable database>>
- Responsive Design: CoinWatch is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
   
## Practiced using Airtable for CRUD (successfully completed CR portions only)
CoinWatch leverages Airtable for Create and Read (CR) operations. Users can create and view their cryptocurrency holdings through the app. Further development can include Update and Delete operations.

## Technology Stack and CSS libs used
CoinWatch is built using the following technologies and libraries:
- React with vite: Frontend framework with user interface.
- Airtable: Used for storing and retrieving cryptocurrency portfolio data.
- Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI (Tailwind CSS component library for additional styling).
- CoinGecko API: Provides real-time cryptocurrency price data.

## Possible Future Developments / Features
CoinWatch has the potential for future enhancements and features, including:
- User Authentication: Implement user accounts for saving portfolios and data.
- Update and Delete Operations: Extend CRUD functionality to allow users to update and delete holdings.
- Multi-Currency Support: Allow users to track portfolios in various fiat currencies.
